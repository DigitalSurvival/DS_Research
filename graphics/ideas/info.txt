I'm not sure how accurate the below text is, but I think it would be neat to somehow create a catchy seven horn design. Possibly by modifying the design of this "horn" graphic to include four more spiralled horns circling in a bigger intersecting radius like these three horns do...

"The Horn - This Christian symbol represents God's power. Being the principal means of defense as well as attack that most animals are endowed with, the horn is symbolic of dominion, power, triumph, fierceness, strength, intelligence, dignity, prosperity and glory. A horn with oil is representative of David being anointed as the King and the seven horns of the Ram stand for the conquering of Jericho (Joshua) by the Israelites.

The word is also used in several popular expressions whose meanings have religious connotations. For instance, the phrase 'horn of plenty' denotes the Almighty's generosity; and 'horn of salvation' refers to Jesus Christ and is representative of a strong savior."
